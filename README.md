Practice for html

I'm really excited to get going on this assignment. I want to try to include 
all the things ive learned thus far into this assignment.
I want to have an ordered list, hyperlinks (both absolute and relative). I want my hyperlinks to open in a seperate tab in the browser. I want to embed an image. I want
to also Bold and Italicize words. Even when starting I'm going to create and organize all of the directories from the command line before I even start doing any html in vscode.
